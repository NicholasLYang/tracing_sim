Concepts to be modeled in code:

Graph structure:
1. Nodes,
2. Edges

Dedicated ingress node where a trace enters:

1. Trace
2. RPC
3. RPC headers.

Computation within each node:

1. Arithmetic
2. Filtering of RPCs
3. Making a call to other services
4. Maintain and update state

Later on:

1. Get WASM runtime into the node.
2. For now, just simulate cc files directly.

Backing store:

1. To write results from each node for persistent storage.
